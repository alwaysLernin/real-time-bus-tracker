# Real Time Bus Tracker
Bootcamp map animation project - My version show Paul Revere's route. I added code that causes the map to recenter as the route markers are being updated.

## How to run -
To see the route, load the page in a browser window and then click the button in the upper left hand corner.

## Future Improvements -
There were several things I tried to add but was initially unsuccesful with, but would like to add in the future:
- add static icons at the starting and ending points (a lantern at the start and a house at the end
- change marker to a horse icon
- draw a line as the marker progresses through the route so the whole route is visible
- smooth out the movement of the map
